EDIT:
All pages should validate now, but the website is not complete. However, it is functional.

EDIT2: I tried to add a feature on the employment.php where a person could submit a resume file.
However, I think that the upload feature is not available in the server.
Besides that, the website is complete. I might add a php validation for the buy.php page yet,
since it is being done with javascript for now...

EDIT3: Added last feature on the catalog.php. Now you click a category and have access to a table
with all products from that category.
Added extra explanation to the howtobuy.php.
Fixed the Our time. The javascript was actually getting the location time instead of the server time.
Now, it is done via php, setting the default timezone to 'America/Halifax'.
All pages are also validating.
